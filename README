CONTRIBUTING

This app is just the beginning. It only implements a small subset of iFixit's
functionality: the native view of a repair guide. We'd love to do all sorts of other
things, too. Here's a wishlist:
 * Create nifty splash home screen, rather than defaulting to web view
 * Add native search
 * Store repair guides offline, so you don't need a net connection to fix things
 * Add native views for Area pages and Device pages, removing most of the need for web
   views.
 * Allow browsing and adding notes
 * Allow browsing and adding notes
 * Allow browsing and adding notes
 * iPhone support
 
We have a small development team, and don't have the resources to do all of these
ourselves. We'd love help! If any of those problems looks interesting to you, fork our
code and hack away!

Got an awesome feature idea that we don't have an API to support yet? Post the request on
meta.ifixit.com and we'll add it to our to-do list.
